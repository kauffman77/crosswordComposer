    An independent set is a set of nodes such that the subgraph
    of G induced by these nodes contains no edges. A maximal
    independent set is an independent set such that it is not possible
    to add a new node and still get an independent set.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph 

    nodes : list or iterable
       Nodes that must be part of the independent set. This set of nodes
       must be independent.

    Returns
    -------
    indep_nodes : list 
       List of nodes that are part of a maximal independent set.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXUnfeasible
       If the nodes in the provided list are not part of the graph or
       do not form an independent set, an exception is raised.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> nx.maximal_independent_set(G) # doctest: +SKIP
    [4, 0, 2]
    >>> nx.maximal_independent_set(G, [1]) # doctest: +SKIP
    [1, 3]
    
    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm does not solve the maximum independent set problem.
